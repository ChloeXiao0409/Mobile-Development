# COMP5216 Mobile Computing - Teaching Materials

**University of Sydney - Semester 2, 2025**

## Week 01 Activity
For week 01 activity, go to this [expo-starter](https://github.sydney.edu.au/COMP5216-2025-S2/COMP5216-2025-Learning-Materials/blob/main/expo-starter/README.md) project.

Once you download the project and run, you must create your own repository under the [organization](https://github.sydney.edu.au/COMP5216-2025-S2) using this name pattern: **COMP5216-2025-MP-unikey** (e.g. COMP5216-2025-MP-abcd1234, replace abcd1234 with your UniKey). Then, push it to your repository. After that, you can copy your repository link and paste it in the quiz on Canvas.
